# Evaluating-and-Debugging-Generative-AI
In the generative AI evaluation service, you can use computation-based metrics through the Pipeline and rapid evaluation Python SDK. The computation-based evaluation might be performed in only pointwise use cases. However, you can directly compare the metrics scores of two models for a pairwise comparison.
